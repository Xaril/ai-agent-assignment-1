# ai-agent-assignment-1

This repository contains a report and code regarding Assignment 1 in the course DD2438 Artificial Intelligence and Multi Agent Systems. In this assignment, 13 groups were tasked with creating algorithms for a car to traverse various maze terrains. 

All coding was done in Unity with the standard asset car. By utilizing its Move function, our algorithms made it traverse the various terrains.

The report contains information regarding the problem, various solutions, the solution we created (for which code exists in this repository), and discussion regarding the different groups' results, such as why some algorithms performed better than others.

Our implementation utilizes the RRT* algorithm with a kinematic motion model of the car. Furthermore, it utilizes a controller to make smarter decisions when planning and executing the path. More information can be found in the report and in the code.
